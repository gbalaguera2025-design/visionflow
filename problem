# Problem & Motivation

Modern cities rely on road traffic, but:

- Accidents and near-misses can happen quickly  
- Humans can’t perfectly monitor many cameras at once  
- Most traffic cameras just record video and don’t “understand” what they see  

## Real-World Problem

This project focuses on a simpler version of a smart-city problem:

> Automatically deciding whether a traffic camera frame shows **traffic** or **no traffic**.

This is useful because it can help:

- Detect when roads are busy or unusually empty  
- Support traffic control centers  
- Serve as a building block for accident detection or congestion alerts  

## Why It Matters

- Better **safety**: faster response to dangerous situations  
- Better **data**: measure how often roads are busy or empty  
- Better **automation**: reduce pressure on humans watching screens all day
