# 🚦 Problem & Motivation

Modern cities depend on road transportation, but:

- Crashes and near-misses can happen in seconds  
- Humans can’t constantly watch every camera feed  
- Most camera systems just record video without understanding it  

---

## 🎯 Project Problem

The simplified problem I tackle in **VisionFlow** is:

> **Given a traffic-camera image, decide whether it shows “traffic” or “no traffic”.**

This is a first step toward:

- Detecting unusual congestion  
- Spotting empty roads when they *should* be busy  
- Supporting real-time traffic dashboards and smart-city planning

## 🌍 Why It Matters

- **Safety** – Faster awareness of potential incidents  
- **Efficiency** – Helps operators monitor many locations  
- **Data** – Provides structured information instead of raw video  

Even though this project uses a small, labeled dataset, the same ideas can extend to:

- Accident detection  
- Multi-class traffic states  
- Integration with automated alerts
