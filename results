## 📌 Baseline Model (AlexNet)

**Settings:**
- Batch size: 32  
- Learning rate: 0.001  
- Augmentation: ON  
- Epochs: 5  

**Performance:**
- Validation Accuracy: ~ **95%**
- Loss curve shows stable learning
- Confusion matrix shows strong class separation

## 🧪 Batch Size Experiments (16 vs 64)

Goal: See how batch size affects training.

- **Batch size 16:** More frequent updates, sometimes noisier curves.  
- **Batch size 64:** Smoother training, sometimes lower accuracy depending on dataset size.

**Observations:**
- Write your summary after viewing wandb plots.

## 🧪 Learning Rate Experiments (0.001 vs 0.0001)

Goal: Test how quickly or slowly the model learns.

- **LR = 0.001:** Fast learning, good accuracy.  
- **LR = 0.0001:** Slower learning but more stable.

**Observations:**
- Which learning rate gave the best validation accuracy?

---

## 🎨 Data Augmentation: ON vs OFF

- Augmentation ON → Better generalization  
- Augmentation OFF → Higher risk of overfitting  

**Observations:**
- Did validation accuracy improve with augmentation?

---

## 🏆 AlexNet vs. ResNet18

Comparison between two CNN architectures:

- **AlexNet:** Lighter and faster  
- **ResNet18:** Deeper, uses skip-connections, often more accurate  

**Observations:**
- Which model performed better on your dataset?

---

## ✔ Takeaways

- AlexNet works well for small traffic datasets  
- Augmentation helps prevent overfitting  
- Batch size and learning rate significantly change performance  
- ResNet18 may outperform AlexNet but takes longer to train
