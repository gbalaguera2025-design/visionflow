# Technical Approach – AlexNet

This project uses **AlexNet**, a convolutional neural network (CNN), to classify traffic camera images into two groups:

- **traffic**
- **no_traffic**

AlexNet was chosen because it is lightweight, fast to train, and performs well on image classification tasks.

## 📂 Dataset

My dataset contains two folders for training and two for validation:


- **Training images:** 160  
- **Validation images:** 40  
- **Classes:** `traffic`, `no_traffic`  
- Loaded using PyTorch’s `ImageFolder()`.

## 🧹 Preprocessing

Before training, each image is:

- Resized to **224 × 224** (AlexNet input size)  
- Converted to a tensor  
- Normalized using ImageNet mean/std  

### ✔ Optional Augmentation (when enabled):
- Random horizontal flips  
- Small random rotations  
- Color jitter  

This helps the model generalize better.

## 🧠 AlexNet Architecture (Simplified)

AlexNet consists of:

1. **Convolution layers** – detect shapes, edges, patterns  
2. **ReLU activations** – add nonlinearity  
3. **MaxPooling layers** – reduce spatial size  
4. **Dropout layers** – prevent overfitting  
5. **Fully connected layers** – final classification  

### ✓ Model Modification

The last layer was changed to output **2 classes**:

```python
model = models.alexnet(weights=models.AlexNet_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)
in_features = model.classifier[6].in_features
model.classifier[6] = nn.Linear(in_features, 2)
